 <h3> <b>Amputees</b></h3>
   
 <p> An amputee is one who does not have all or part of a limb (arms and legs). Not all amputees are the same. Some athletes were born without a member or part of a member. Others have lost limbs or limbs due to illness (such as cancer or diabetes), or as a result of an accident. Amputations can affect the balance and walking ability of an individual. In order to improve their locomotion, some athletes use prostheses. </p>

  <p> Athletes with physical disabilities are classified in each sport modality through the functional classification system. This system aims to classify athletes with different physical disabilities in the same functional profile for the competition. Its goal is to ensure that the achievement of a medal by an athlete is the result of their training, experience, motivation and not due to the advantages obtained by the type or level of their disability. In swimming, there are 10 classes for backstroke, free and dolphin, 10 classes for the medley and 9 classes for the chest. Athletes with visual impairment, already undergo a medical classification, based on their visual ability. Among the visually impaired athletes, there are only 3 classes. Although these ranks are accepted by the International Paralympic Committee - IPC, there is a lot of controversy regarding these systems and many athletes are protested during the competitions.</p>

     <h3> <b>Spinal Cord Injury</b></h3>

 <p> Marrow injuries (spinal injuries) can result in paralysis, which can affect the movements of the lower limbs or even of the entire body. The degree of impairment of a spinal cord lesion depends on the location in the cervical spine where the injury occurred. In general, the higher the spine injury, the lower the body's function, as more muscles are affected. </p>

     <p> There are two definitions of spinal cord injuries: paraplegia and quadriplegia. These are very broad terms, and the movements may vary from person to person. For the purpose of this site, choose one of two terms. If you are not sure which one to choose, see the descriptions of both terms and decide which description is closest to your disability: </p>

   <p> Paraplegia is caused by low bone marrow injury. It is usually the result of a spinal cord injury, or a congenital condition, such as spina bifida. </p>

       <p> Quadriplegia is caused by a high lesion in the medulla, or brain. The injury causes the person to lose full or partial control of the use of arms, legs and trunk. </p>

     <p> There is no division of classes for athletes with intellectual disabilities, and all compete with each other, regardless of their learning difficulties. In swimming and athletics, some races are available to athletes of these modalities. Athletes who may have an intellectual and physical disability may opt for one of two forms of competition: or between intellectual or physical handicaps. </p>

    <h3> <b>Cerebral Palsy</b></h3>

    <p>Cerebral palsy is a set of permanent disorders that affect movement and posture. Symptoms occur due to a disorder that occurs during the development of the brain, most often before birth.
Signs and symptoms appear during childhood or preschool. People with cerebral palsy may have difficulty with swallowing and usually have an imbalance in the eye muscle. The range of motion can be reduced in various joints of the body due to muscle stiffness.
The effect of cerebral palsy on functional abilities varies greatly. Some people are able to walk while others are not. Some people show normal intellectual function, while others may have intellectual disability. Epilepsy, blindness or deafness are conditions that may be present.</p>
