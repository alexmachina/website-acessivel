            <b>History of the Paralympics</b></h3>
<p>Paralympic or Paralympic Games are the largest sports event involving people with disabilities. It includes athletes with physical disabilities (mobility, amputations, blindness or cerebral palsy) as well as mentally handicapped. First performed in 1960 in Rome, Italy, it has its origins in Stoke Mandeville, England, where it functions as the first sports competitions for disabled people, as a way to rehabilitate soldiers injured in World War II.</p>

<p>The success of the first competitions provided a rapid growth to the Paralympic movement, which in 1976 already had forty countries. In that same year was held the first edition of the Winter Games, leading to more disabled people the possibility of playing sports at a high level. The 1992 Barcelona Games represented a milestone for the event, as for the first time the organizing committees of the Olympic and Paralympic Games worked together. The support of the International Olympic Committee after the Seoul Games in 1988 provided the founding, in 1989, of the International Paralympic Committee. Since then the two bodies have developed joint actions aimed at the development of sport for the disabled.

         <b>Paralympics: overcoming the limit</b></h3>
<p>However, the greatest glory of the Olympics of the disabled is not only in the achievement of medals and in the competition itself, it is mainly in the example that these athletes pass to hundreds of thousands who live stigmatized by their physical and mental deficiencies and without perspectives in their houses. Even those who do not aspire to be an athlete can at least find inspiration and courage to follow the news, where they end up identifying with those who have overcome the numerous difficulties with a lot of struggle, courage, persistence and dedication for some sport. Knowing that there are people who despite the difficulties of all order went to the fight and won in the sport, can radiate optimism, raise self-esteem and reorient the perspectives in many people.

<p>The famous phrase of Baron de Coubertin, now worn out in the Olympics, seems to make more sense as a slogan for Paralympic athletes, as they know and feel that "the important thing is not to win a medal but simply to compete." The Paralympic athlete before competing nationally and internationally had to compete with himself; Without a doubt, overcoming this first subjective obstacle has no medal that can reward it. </p>

His paralympic career spanned 24 years from 1980-2004. Trek was also a reserve for the 1980 American Olympics swimming team, but did not attend the Olympic Games due to the American boycott of the event. Ragnhild Myklebust of Norway holds the record for being the biggest medal winner of the Paralympics Winter Games. </p>

    <p>Brazil has been featured in the last editions of the Paralympic Games. The country debuted in 1976 and won its first medal in the next edition. In 2008, for the first time finished an edition among the top ten in the medal table, ranking ninth with 47 medals. Swimmers Clodoaldo Silva and Daniel Dias and runners Lucas Prado, Ádria Santos and Terezinha Guilhermina are some of the sporting highlights of the country.

<p>Brazil in Athens competed in 13 of the 19 sports competitions and won 14th place with 14 gold medals, 12 silver medals and 7 bronze medals, totaling 33 medals. The growth of the Paralympic sport has a simple explanation: financing, says the president of the Brazilian Paralympic Committee, Vital Severino Neto, who is visually impaired. 
In Beijing, in 2008, the competition was more intense, Brazil managed to improve its performance and was in 32nd place, with 30 gold medals, 41 silver and 46 bronze, 117 in total.</p>

<p>Abolishing participation rates, Athens 2004 wanted to eliminate all discrimination between athletes who make the Olympic and Paralympic Games. In addition to the abolition of fees, Athens 2004 had the first organizing committee for the Olympic Games which, operating under a unified management structure, was responsible for organizing both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Para-Olympic Games division was responsible for providing strategic planning, coordination and support to the entire committee, while working closely with the International Para-Clean Committee.</p>
